Abstract:
---------

Checkwiki helps clean up syntax and other errors in the source code of Wikipedia by finding and fixing problems such as:

* Eliminating errors in the wiki syntax, such as missing close tags or brackets;
* Checking for accessibility issues, such as small print or heading problems;
* Correcting, deleting or moving code that does not follow conventions, such as the position of references with respect to punctuation;
* Finding articles that have invalid ISBNs
